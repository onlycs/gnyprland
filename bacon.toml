default_job = "run-long"

# Run your long-running application (eg server) and have the result displayed in bacon.
# For programs that never stop (eg a server), `background` is set to false
# to have the cargo run output immediately displayed instead of waiting for
# program's end.
# 'on_change_strategy' is set to `kill_then_restart` to have your program restart
# on every change (an alternative would be to use the 'F5' key manually in bacon).
# If you often use this job, it makes sense to override the 'r' key by adding
# a binding `r = job:run-long` at the end of this file .
