# hyprland

A custom version of `hyprland-rs` because hyprland-rs is outdated, buggy, and I don't want to dig through
someone else's code to find the bugs.

This is hypr-specific (get it?) so it only does what I need it to do. Want a bug free hyprland-rs? Get wrecked lol. Or add to this, I made it easy to add new features, cause I'm going to need to someday, anyways.
